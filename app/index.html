      <h2>Announcements</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>I am hiring a postdoc interested in Reeb graphs, mapper graphs, merge trees, and the interleaving distance. More information is <a href="https://cmse.msu.edu/employment-opportunities/postdocs/">here</a>.</li>
        <li>The teaspoon code is up and running: <a href="https://gitlab.msu.edu/TSAwithTDA/teaspoon">Code</a> <a href="http://elizabethmunch.com/math/teaspoon/index.html">Documentation</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.albany.edu/~AS929879/">Anastasios Stefanou</a>'s paper on generalizations of the interleaving distance is now available on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04095v1.pdf">arXiv</a>.</li>
        <li>I am moving to <a href="https://msu.edu/">Michigan State University</a>! Starting August, 2017, I will be Assistant Professor with a primary appointment in the <a href="https://cmse.msu.edu/">Department of Computational Mathematics, Statistics, and Engineering</a> and a secondary appointment in the <a href="https://math.msu.edu/">Department of Mathematics</a>.</li>
        <li>In Fall 2017, I am teaching <strong>CMSE 491/890 - Topological Analysis of Large Datasets</strong>. This course will be of interest to anyone with a bit of computational experience (I will teach in python, but experience in another language such as Matlab, Julia, etc, should be enough to get you through). More info is on my <a href="/math/teaching/">teaching page</a>, in the <a href="/math/teaching/CMSE491-Fall2017-policy.pdf">tentative syllabus</a>, or on <a href="https://d2l.msu.edu">D2L</a>.</li>
        <li>In Spring 2018, I am teaching CMSE 201. More info to follow.</li>
